          building full-stack web applications using technologies like React, Express & Webpack. I always strive to

        <h3>Outside of Work</h3>
        <p>
          When I'm not building websites and APIs, I enjoy exploring the great outdoors. Mostly, I am a hiker, a runner,
          and a photographer.
