# About This Site

This site was designed to be minimalistic. I simply wanted to create a virtual resume that would be easy for recruiters and employers to view and find the information they needed quickly and easily. I added minimal styling and animations - again, the focus here is the content of the site.

### Technologies/Libraries Used:

- TypesScript (`typescript`) - Type-safe JavaScript
- React (`react`) - Rendering Framework
- Panda CSS (`@pandacss/dev`) - Minimal JSS in CSS Library
